In traditional programming languages, like Java or Python, operations are often blocking â€” meaning they wait until a task (like file reading or database fetching) is complete before moving on.

Node.js, on the other hand, uses an event-driven architecture. When Node.js needs to perform a task (like reading a file), it sends that task to the system kernel and moves on to the next instruction. The event loop continuously checks if tasks are complete and triggers callback functions when they are.

ðŸ”„ How the Event Loop Works
The event loop operates in phases, each handling a specific type of callback:

Timers Phase â€“ Executes setTimeout() and setInterval() callbacks.

Pending Callbacks Phase â€“ Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop.

Idle, Prepare Phase â€“ Internal use only.

Poll Phase â€“ Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O callbacks.

Check Phase â€“ Executes setImmediate() callbacks.

Close Callbacks Phase â€“ Handles things like socket.on('close').

Between each phase, Node may check for tasks in the microtask queue (e.g., .then() callbacks from Promises).
